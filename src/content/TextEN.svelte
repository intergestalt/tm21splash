  The dilemma for refusal has never felt quite so urgent. Easily misunderstood
  as a gesture of inaction and passivity where nothing happens, a refusal
  instead can be an insistence on an alternative or a demand for reform. From
  boycotts to strikes to collective or individual withdrawals, the long and
  paradoxical history of refusal suggests political and social imaginaries that
  say more than a mere no. As an act that often carries with it both risk and
  promise, a refusal opens up possibilities for worlds that can and should be.
</p>
<p>
  The task of refusing is not without its difficulties – it is made up of
  compromise and friction, and demands for acting and imagining in ways that lie
  outside the status quo. Manifesting in many forms, a refusal can call
  attention to uncommon and messy practices, crucial to the critique and
  reinvention of our material world. For some, refusal is a luxury that stems
  from an advantage; for others, it manifests from regressive, reactionary
  politics. Too often refusal is a stance adopted after years of exile,
  exclusion, or oppression. It asks for multiplicity, difference, and
  co-existence, rather than fixed systems of logic that organise and tie
  socio-political lives to undeclared algorithmic biases and colonial histories.
  While striving to open narrow political possibilities, refusal is motivated by
  the hope of building new commitments and relations.
</p>
<p>
  From the small acts of refusal that reside in the mundane and everyday, to
  tender forms of resistance that allow us to repair collective infrastructure,
  transmediale 2021–22 will map out the political agency of refusal, examining
  its potential to form new socio-political realities grounded in care, hope,
  and desire.
</p>
<p>
  Taking place over the course of a year, the upcoming edition of transmediale
  will present a collection of exhibitions, screenings, and discourse
  programmes, which, along with residencies, workshops, and commissions, will
  explore the material, technological, and cultural aspects of refusal.
  Unfolding via online and in-person events, this new expanded structure,
  formulated in response to COVID-19, will create a year-long engagement with
  the festival theme.
</p>

<p>
  With an exhibition across two venues in Berlin, and an extended film programme 
  at transmediale studio, our year-long festival begins on 23 January 2021. 
  Challenging systems of control and exerting new socio-political pressures, 
  the first part of our programme brings together a collection of artistic positions 
  that offer possibilities and hope through tactics for refusal.
