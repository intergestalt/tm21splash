  The upcoming edition of transmediale takes place over the course of a year 
  and presents a collection of exhibitions, screenings, and discourse 
  programmes, which, along with residencies, workshops, and commissions, will 
  explore the material, technological, and cultural aspects of refusal. 
  Unfolding via online and in-person events, this new expanded structure, 
  formulated in response to COVID-19, will create a year-long engagement 
  with the festival theme.
</p>
<p>
  The festival begins on 28 January with the launch of our new digital platform,
  the <i>Almanac for Refusal</i>. The exhibition <i>Rendering Refusal</i> will 
  take place across two venues in Kunstraum Kreuzberg/Bethanien and Betonhalle, 
  Silent Green Kulturquartier. The film programme <i>remote.response.request.</i>
  presents a monthly series of film screenings and artist exchanges installed 
  at transmediale studio at Silent Green Kulturquartier. 
</p>
<p>
  Public access to the exhibition and film programme will be available as soon 
  as government regulations around the pandemic allow. We will facilitate 
  additional access to the exhibition <i>Rendering Refusal</i> through a remote 
  visitor programme and extensive documentation.
</p>
<h3>Almanac for Refusal</h3>
<p>
  As part of its year-long programme transmediale 2021–22 launches a new 
  digital platform on 28 January. Our <i>Almanac for Refusal</i> brings 
  together a collection of browser-based artworks; films, photo-essays, texts, 
  graphs, images, podcasts, sound experiments, and more. Inspired by almanac 
  traditions, the collection will update at the end of each lunar cycle and act
  as a guide to the festival. Throughout the year, the <i>Almanac for Refusal</i> 
  will include contributions and artworks from artists, designers, researchers, 
  and activists whose practices map out the ways refusal can unfold and how it 
  circumvents the status quo.
</p>
<h3>Exhibition<br />
Rendering Refusal</h3>
<p>
  Exploring what can emerge when hope and refusal work together, <i>Rendering Refusal</i> 
  presents fourteen artists whose works enact imaginative, speculative, and 
  poetic strategies of non-compliance. Taking place across two venues in 
  Kunstraum Kreuzberg/Bethanien and Betonhalle, Silent Green Kulturquartier, 
  the exhibition runs until 28 March. Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, 
  public access to the exhibition will be available as soon as government 
  regulations around the pandemic allow.
</p>
<p>
  We will facilitate access to the exhibition both through extensive documentation
  and Remote Visits. Visitors can connect via video call with an exhibition 
  guide at the venue and experience the exhibition with them. Through these 
  Remote Visits, we wish to provide a unique viewing experience, enabled by 
  technology, that widen accessibility to both venues. Remote Visits can be 
  booked for both venues on our website from February.
</p>
<h3>Film Programme<br />
  remote.response.request.</h3>
<p>
  Conceived in response to film’s current state of suspension during the 
  pandemic, <i>remote.response.request.</i> maps new approaches to ‘add to the 
  image’ through three-month-long installations at the transmediale studio. 
  Forming new relations between viewers and the moving image, these 
  installations bring together filmmakers, academics, and performers, in a 
  series of commissioned works produced at a distance. The first series of 
  <i>remote.response.request.</i>, invokes the evocative concept of the radical 
  imagination through work that ask us not only to envision but to live, 
  different ways of being.
</p>
<p>
  Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, public access to the film programme 
  will be available as soon as government regulations allow. 
</p>
<h3>Theme<br />
for refusal</h3>
<p>
  The dilemma <i>for refusal</i> has never felt quite so urgent. Easily misunderstood
  as a gesture of inaction and passivity where nothing happens, a refusal
  instead can be an insistence on an alternative or a demand for reform. From
  boycotts to strikes to collective or individual withdrawals, the long and
  paradoxical history of refusal suggests political and social imaginaries that
  say more than a mere no. As an act that often carries with it both risk and
  promise, a refusal opens up possibilities for worlds that can and should be.
</p>

<p>
  The task of refusing is not without its difficulties – it is made up of
  compromise and friction, and demands for acting and imagining in ways that lie
  outside the status quo. Manifesting in many forms, a refusal can call
  attention to uncommon and messy practices, crucial to the critique and
  reinvention of our material world. For some, refusal is a luxury that stems
  from an advantage; for others, it manifests from regressive, reactionary
  politics. Too often refusal is a stance adopted after years of exile,
  exclusion, or oppression. It asks for multiplicity, difference, and
  co-existence, rather than fixed systems of logic that organise and tie
  socio-political lives to undeclared algorithmic biases and colonial histories.
  While striving to open narrow political possibilities, refusal is motivated by
  the hope of building new commitments and relations.
</p>
<p>
  From the small acts of refusal that reside in the mundane and everyday, to
  tender forms of resistance that allow us to repair collective infrastructure,
  transmediale 2021–22 will map out the political agency of refusal, examining
  its potential to form new socio-political realities grounded in care, hope,
  and desire.
</p>
<h3>transmediale x CTM Festival</h3>
<p>
  <i>rehearsal letter</i> is a recorded studio session for transmediale x CTM 
  2021, produced as part of the soundtrack for artist Frances Scott’s 
  forthcoming work <i>Wendy</i>, a film fan-letter to composer and musician 
  Wendy Carlos. In 2016, musician and instrument designer Tom Richards built 
  the <i>Mini Oramics machine</i>, based on an original 1976 design by 
  composer and inventor Daphne Oram. This musical interface allows the
  composer to draw graphic scores on overhead projector rolls, which are then 
  read directly by the machine, creating ‘drawn sound synthesis’. Here, 
  drawn-sound is used as a method of re-interpreting pages from Carlos’ 
  original scores from <i>Timesteps and Theme Tune for A Clockwork Orange (Beethovania)</i> 
  (1971).
</p>
<p>
  <i>rehearsal letter</i> will be accessible online in the <i>Almanac for Refusal</i> from 28 January.
</p>
<h3>VORSPIEL</h3>
<p>
  Starting from 15 January, the 10th-anniversary edition of Vorspiel will take 
  place online and in-person. Presented by transmediale and CTM, the 
  pre-festival programme will once more offer space for digital art and culture,
  as well as experimental music and sound art. Curated by the 35 participating
  venues, the programme aims to facilitate critical discourse on art, technology,
  politics, and identity through ongoing exchange and reflection.
</p>
<p>
Further information on participating venues and events will be listed on the
